# class 5

We are going to create a list that contain vector with the information about name, age, fellowship, year and department.

## Steps

- open R
- create a list name called `infoIGIB`.
- now add information about a student. 
  Example,
```{R}
rintu <- c('name' = 'Rintu Kutum',
	   'age' = 28,
	   'fellowship' = 'Project Fellow',
	   'year' = 2012,
	   'department' = 'GNR Knowlegde centre for Genome informatics')


```
